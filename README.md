**One-line solution:** Flip your phone upside down so “level 9” reads like “level 6”, then tap the (now inverted) top-left icon.

## What this repo is
A tiny, no-build web recreation of **Game is Hard – Level 6**.
- Same bait: **“level 9”** + **“something is wrong!”**
- Same trick: **phone orientation** (upside down)
- Same finish: **tap the top-left icon only after the flip**

## Level 6 walkthrough (fast)
1. Stop tapping random stuff.
2. Physically rotate your phone **180°** (charging port up).
3. Keep it inverted.
4. Tap the top-left icon to clear.

### Pro-tip
If you’re speed-running: flip instantly on load, then tap where the icon is. Don’t read the text. It’s there to waste your time.

## Run the demo
### Option A: double-click (quick test)
Open `index.html` in a browser.

### Option B: local server (better for mobile sensors)
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
